- Sick of using ranger and other various file manager TUI's to manage your videos? Well, me too.
- You are a computing nerd who hates GUI's for better? Well, me too.
- You want a useful TUI manager? Well, me too!

This is a simple terminal-based app I built using Python that lets you browse and play video files directly from your terminal. I used the **Textual** library to create an interactive UI, so you can easily scroll through your videos and play them with **mpv**, all from within the terminal.

## Why TF?

- **Scrollbar Included**: TUI with scrollbar is sensual.
- **Minimalist**
- **All femboys are welcome**: It comes with popular themes such as gruvbox, monokai, dracula, solarized, etc. 
- **Cross-Platform**: It works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, as long as you have **mpv** and **Textual** installed.
- **Open Source!**: You can fork it and add your own features? Now that's that good FOSS feeling.

## You convinced me, magic man!

1. Install mpv, duh...
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S mpv
   sudo dnf install mpv
   sudo zypper install mpv
   sudo apk add mpv
   ... (and all your other distros)

...sorry I don't know the package manager for your custom FurryBSD

2. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install textual
   pip install pathlib

Note: Pathlib should be in your system already, if you don't have it, you can install it.

## Usage
Run it with Python and enjoy that good FOSSnerd mechanism.


## Future Updates

    I plan to add features for managing files (like renaming or deleting them) VERY SOON, LIKE I'M WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW.
    Maybe Iâ€™ll add playlist support in the future. DON'T COUNT ON IT.
